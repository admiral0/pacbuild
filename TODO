Things left to do
-----------------

- Automatic chroot rebuilding (either triggered by apple or a "no update since" timer)

- aufs2 support (cheap from makearmpkg, must pythonize) 

- Dependency handling (know what packages other packages depend on)

  - Repo contents knowledge

    - Apple will have to know all the versions of all the packages in all the repos for all the architectures

  - New status -- inrepo

    - When a package moves from built to in the repo, we need to know its the one we can access and no others

  - New status -- depwait

    - When a package can't be built because another package isn't built yet

- Arm support

- Test distcc

- Rewrite waka
